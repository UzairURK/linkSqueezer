A simple Java GUI application that shortens URLs. This app allows users to input a long URL and generates a shorter, more manageable URL that can be easily shared with others. The application implements a custom URL shortening algorithm and validates the entered URL to ensure that it is a valid URL before attempting to generate a shortened URL. Users can customize the shortened URL by providing a user-defined alias or keyword. The original and shortened URLs are stored in a local database hosted on a local network or on AWS.
